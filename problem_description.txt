Abstract:
    I try Angr in two programs. One is the compiler (under ./src). Another is the plain program (under ./min_src). 
    Both programs are compiled using same command (seen in Makefile). After loading to Angr, angr's debug support (state. dvars)
    shows that the variable information of the compiler program is empty, after reporting warning:  
    "| angr.knowledge_plugins.debug_variables | Unsupported variable with overlapping scopes. Have "None" with 4212856-4213105 and ignore 4212856-4213105."

    The detailed execution steps are shown in "log_work.txt" and "log_not_work.txt"

Updates:
    08/10:
        Debug_variables information is handled by "angr.knowledge_plugins.debug_variables".
        Experiments show that after calling Angr's "proj.kb.dvars.load_from_dwarf()",
        the min program (under ./min_src) show a whole list of variables including local, global, function parameters.
        While the compiler program only show a list of variables named "__*", such as "__dso_handle", "__initialize_p".
        No user defined variables is spotted.

        corresponding execution steps are shown in the two logs file.

Direction to explore:
    1. check generated DWARF file
    2. check Angr's debug plugin
